Else, print "Point is on the axis."
09. [ ] Number Range Check - Take an integer as input. If the number is between 1 and 10 (inclusive), print "In range." Else, print "Out of range."
10. [ ] Simple Calculator - Take two floats and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input. Perform the operation and print the result. If the operator is invalid, print "Invalid operator."


## switch case problems

01. [ ] Traffic Light Simulation - Take a character (R, Y, G) as input. Use a switch-case to print the corresponding action (R = Stop, Y = Wait, G = Go).
02. [ ] Day of the Week - Take an integer (1–7) as input. Use a switch-case to print the day of the week (1 = Monday, ..., 7 = Sunday)

06. [ ] Character Type - Take a character as input. Use a switch-case to determine if it is a vowel, consonant, digit, or special character.
07. [ ] Currency Denomination - Take an integer (1–5) as input. Use a switch-case to print the denomination (1 = Penny, 2 = Nickel, 3 = Dime, 4 = Quarter, 5 = Dollar).
08. [ ] Number of Days in a Month - Take an integer (1–12) as input. Use a switch-case to print the number of days in that month. Consider February as having 28 days.
09. [ ] Menu Selection - Take an integer (1–5) as input for a menu. Use a switch-case to print the selected option (1 = Add, 2 = Update, 3 = Delete, 4 = View, 5 = Exit).
10. [ ] Direction Selection - Take an integer (1–4) as input. Use a switch-case to print the corresponding direction (1 = North, 2 = South, 3 = East, 4 = West).


# Looping Problems

## for loop
